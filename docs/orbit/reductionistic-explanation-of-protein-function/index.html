                            question="Difference between real genetics and Typogenetics: context-free function of amino acids"
                            
                            
                          answer="In Typogenetics, each amino acid of an enzyme is responsible for a single action, but in real genetics it is the tertiary structure of the enzyme as a whole which determines the function of the enzyme, so one cannot just look at a single amino acid in isolation in a context-free way to determine its function
