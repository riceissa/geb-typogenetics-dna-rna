                            question="What determines the tertiary structure of a protein?"
                            
                            
                          answer="It is implicit in and completely determined by the primary structure: the sequence of amino acids

note: In other words, once mRNA is translated by *any* ribosome into protein, it will always have the *same* tertiary structure. It's not as if two different ribosomes will somehow &quot;fold up&quot; the protein into different shapes. The folding just happens on its own, completely determined by the order in which the amino acids appear in the protein.  
  
However, there are also things called molecular chaperones <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)> and the Wikipedia page there mentions that proteins can be &quot;misfolded&quot;, so probably reality is more complicated than this basic picture.
