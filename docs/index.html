  </div>

  <h2>A way to remember what you have learned.</h2>

  <br/>
  <p>Buried deep within the 700+ pages of Douglas Hofstadter's
  <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i> is an excellent
  standalone introductory exposition of DNA, RNA, and all of that (basic
  molecular genetics).  This website provides digital flashcards for
  this portion of the book.  Specifically, it covers Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and
  Self-Rep, pp. 504–532.</p>

  <p>Because GEB is copyrighted, you will have to bring your own copy of the
  book. But assuming you have a copy, you can collect the cards on this website
  as you read along. Go to page 504 in GEB (starting at the section heading "Typogenetics"). Read one section at
    a time, and each time you finish a section, come to this site and review the
    cards corresponding to that section.  This this way, you have a read → review
    loop that will help you to internalize the material better!</p>
