  <title>GEB DNA/RNA flashcards</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Buried deep within the 700+ pages of Douglas Hofstadter's
  <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i> is an excellent
  standalone introductory exposition of DNA, RNA, and all of that (basic
  molecular genetics).  This website provides digital flashcards for
  this portion of the book.  Specifically, it covers Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and
  Self-Rep, pp. 504–532.</p>

  <p>These flashcards are not low-effort cloze deletions or ChatGPT-generated
  or anything like that.  I have about 5 years of serious Anki prompt-writing
  experience, and the cards follow current best practices for prompts as
  explained in e.g. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/">Andy
  Matuschak’s prompt-writing guide</a>.</p>

  <p>Because GEB is copyrighted, you will have to bring your own copy of the
  book. But assuming you have a copy, you can collect the cards on this website
  as you read along.</p>

  <p>There are three ways to use this website.</p>

  <p>Download Anki deck (good if you are already an Anki user and just want the whole deck so you can import it)</p>
  <p><a href="orbit/">Review cards using Orbit</a> (good if you don't want to install anki, and just want a simple SRS that you can use in the browser)</p>
  <p><a href="browse/">Just show me the cards in a single webpage</a> (good if you don't want to install anki, don't want to sign up for orbit, don't want to turn on javascript, or if you just want to search through all the cards, or pick and choose which cards you want to add to your own SRS)</p>
