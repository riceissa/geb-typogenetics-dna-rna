  <p>There are three ways to use this website.</p>

  <p>Download Anki deck (good if you are already an Anki user and just want the whole deck so you can import it)</p>
  <p><a href="orbit/">Review cards using Orbit</a> (good if you don't want to install anki, and just want a simple SRS that you can use in the browser)</p>
  <p>Just show me the cards in a single webpage (good if you don't want to install anki, don't want to sign up for orbit, don't want to turn on javascript, or if you just want to search through all the cards, or pick and choose which cards you want to add to your own SRS)</p>
